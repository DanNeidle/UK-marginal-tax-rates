# UK marginal tax rate calculator

The spreadsheeet models marginal tax rates following the Autumn statement, and lets you compare with the previous position. You can change inputs (rates, thresholds, personal allowance, and a simple inflation calculator). The results are charted, and compared with the pre-Autumn statement position.

There is also a web app coded by a kind volunteer. It has less flexibility, but is much easier to use. Lets you calculate your true marginal income tax rate, based on marital status and number of children.
